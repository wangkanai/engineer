# Engineer IDE - Comprehensive UI/UX Wireframe Design Requirements

## Project Overview

Engineer IDE represents a revolutionary paradigm shift in software development environments, specifically designed for **context engineers** who focus on high-level strategic thinking while AI agents handle implementation details. This interface must support a fundamentally different workflow from traditional code-centric IDEs, prioritizing context definition, AI collaboration, and strategic oversight over syntax editing.

The interface serves as a collaboration platform between human intelligence (strategy, creativity, problem-solving) and artificial intelligence (implementation, repetitive tasks, code generation). Every design decision should reflect this human-AI partnership, creating an environment that amplifies human cognitive abilities rather than competing for attention.

## Core Design Philosophy

### Cognitive Load Minimization
The interface must function as "calm technology" that recedes into the background during intensive thinking sessions. Context engineering requires sustained mental focus on complex conceptual problems, making it essential that the visual design never competes with the user's cognitive resources. This principle drives our low-contrast, monotone color approach and minimal visual hierarchy.

### Spatial Hierarchy for Mental Models
The layout structure should reinforce the user's mental model of their workflow. Traditional development tools (file management, version control) occupy the left space, while AI collaboration tools occupy the right space, with the central area reserved for high-level context work. This spatial organization reduces cognitive overhead by creating predictable, logical tool placement.

### Context-First Information Architecture
Unlike traditional IDEs that prioritize code editing, this interface places context definition at the center of the user experience. The main workspace should feel spacious and conducive to strategic thinking, with implementation details and system feedback relegated to supporting roles in the visual hierarchy.

## Content Examples & Context Engineering Workflow

### Context Mode Form Structure
The Context mode should present a form-based interface that guides users through defining their project requirements systematically. This represents the core innovation of the Engineer IDE - transforming vague ideas into structured, AI-implementable specifications.

#### Form Sections (in order of presentation)
1. **Project Purpose** (multiline text area, 100px height)
   - Placeholder: "Describe what this project aims to achieve..."
   - Helper text: "Focus on business value and user outcomes"

2. **Key Requirements** (multiline text area, 120px height)
   - Placeholder: "List the key functional requirements..."
   - Helper text: "Be specific about features and capabilities"

3. **Technical Constraints** (multiline text area, 120px height)
   - Placeholder: "Specify technical limitations and requirements..."
   - Helper text: "Include frameworks, performance requirements, integrations"

4. **Architecture Preferences** (dropdown + text area, 80px height)
   - Dropdown options: Clean Architecture, Microservices, Monolithic, Custom
   - Additional text area for specific architectural decisions

5. **Success Criteria** (multiline text area, 100px height)
   - Placeholder: "How will you measure project success..."
   - Helper text: "Define measurable outcomes and quality gates"

#### Action Button Placement
- **AI Suggest**: Triggers AI analysis of current context for suggestions
- **Validate**: Runs context validation against best practices
- **Generate**: Initiates AI implementation based on defined context
- **Save Template**: Saves current context as reusable template

### AI Chat Interface Content
The AI chat panel should demonstrate the collaborative nature of context engineering, showing how engineers guide and review AI work rather than implementing directly.

#### Sample Conversation Flow
```
AI: I've analyzed your context and generated the CustomerController with the following features:
- CRUD operations with proper HTTP status codes
- Email validation using data annotations
- Audit logging through Entity Framework interceptors
- Pagination support for list operations

Would you like me to add any additional validation rules or modify the approach?

You: The email validation looks good, but I want to ensure we're handling concurrent updates properly. Can you implement optimistic concurrency control?

AI: Excellent point! I've added optimistic concurrency control using Entity Framework's concurrency tokens. The Customer entity now includes a RowVersion property, and the update operations handle DbUpdateConcurrencyException appropriately. 

I've also updated the API to return proper 409 Conflict responses when concurrent updates occur. Would you like me to generate unit tests for the concurrency scenarios?

You: Yes, please create comprehensive tests for concurrent update scenarios.
```

This conversation demonstrates the context engineer's role: providing strategic guidance while AI handles implementation details.

## Technical Implementation Notes

### MAUI Blazor Hybrid Considerations
Since this interface will be implemented using .NET MAUI Blazor Hybrid, certain design decisions optimize for this technology stack:

- **Layout System**: Uses CSS Grid for precise positioning that translates well to Blazor components
- **Component Architecture**: Each major section (sidebars, panels, workspace) should be separate Blazor components
- **State Management**: Global state management for theme, active tabs, panel visibility
- **Responsive Behavior**: Fixed desktop layout optimized for development workflows
- **Performance**: Minimal re-rendering through proper component isolation

### Accessibility Requirements
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard accessibility for all interactive elements
- **Screen Reader Support**: Proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML structure
- **Color Contrast**: All text meets WCAG AA standards (minimum 4.5:1 ratio)
- **Focus Management**: Clear focus indicators that work with low-contrast design
- **Theme Support**: High contrast mode compatibility

### Animation & Interaction Guidelines
- **Subtle Animations**: Prefer functional animations over decorative ones
- **Performance**: All animations should maintain 60fps on target hardware
- **Reduced Motion**: Respect user preferences for reduced motion
- **Feedback Timing**: Immediate feedback for clicks, 200ms for state changes
- **Loading States**: Clear progress indication for AI operations

## Success Metrics & Validation

The success of this interface design should be measured against its ability to support effective context engineering workflows:

### User Experience Metrics
- **Cognitive Load**: Time spent locating tools vs. time spent on strategic thinking
- **Workflow Efficiency**: Speed of context definition to implementation cycles
- **AI Collaboration Quality**: Effectiveness of human-AI communication through the interface
- **Learning Curve**: Time for traditional developers to become effective context engineers

### Technical Performance Metrics
- **Interface Responsiveness**: Sub-100ms response times for all interactions
- **Memory Usage**: Efficient resource utilization during extended sessions
- **Cross-Platform Consistency**: Identical experience across Windows, macOS, and mobile
- **Accessibility Compliance**: Full WCAG 2.1 AA compliance across all features

This comprehensive design specification provides the foundation for creating a revolutionary development environment that truly supports the context engineering paradigm, enabling humans and AI to collaborate effectively in creating software solutions.
