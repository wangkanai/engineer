# Project Context Knowledge - Design Summary
## Strategic Information Architecture for Context Engineering

### Overview

The Project Context Knowledge system represents the foundational intelligence layer of Engineer IDE, transforming how software development projects capture, organize, and leverage strategic information. Unlike traditional documentation approaches that treat context as an afterthought, this system places structured context knowledge at the center of the development workflow, enabling AI agents to make informed implementation decisions that align with human strategic intent.

This design summary outlines how project context knowledge is captured, validated, evolved, and utilized throughout the development lifecycle to create a seamless human-AI collaboration environment.

## Core Design Philosophy

### Context as First-Class Entity

Project context knowledge is treated as the primary asset in the development process, not supplementary documentation. Every piece of strategic information—from high-level business objectives to specific technical constraints—is captured in structured formats that both humans and AI systems can interpret and act upon.

**Key Principles:**
- **Structured Capture**: Context is gathered through guided interfaces that ensure completeness and consistency
- **Living Documentation**: Context evolves dynamically as projects progress and requirements clarify
- **AI Interpretability**: All context information is formatted for optimal AI understanding and decision-making
- **Human Readability**: Context remains accessible and meaningful to human stakeholders throughout the project lifecycle

### Hierarchical Knowledge Organization

Context knowledge is organized in logical hierarchies that mirror strategic thinking patterns, enabling both human comprehension and AI analysis.

**Knowledge Hierarchy:**
1. **Strategic Layer**: Business objectives, user outcomes, success criteria
2. **Architectural Layer**: System design decisions, technology choices, integration requirements
3. **Constraint Layer**: Technical limitations, performance requirements, compliance needs
4. **Implementation Layer**: Specific requirements, feature specifications, acceptance criteria
5. **Validation Layer**: Testing strategies, quality gates, deployment criteria
