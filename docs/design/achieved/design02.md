    1. Database query optimization for 10k concurrent users
    2. API response time targets vs. complex business logic
    3. Real-time notification system scalability
    
    Recommendations:
    - Consider CQRS pattern for read/write optimization
    - Implement caching strategy for frequent queries  
    - Use event-driven architecture for notifications
    
    Would you like me to update the technical constraints with these considerations?"

**Implementation Strategy Discussions**
```
Human: "Generate implementation approach for customer management context"
AI: "I've analyzed your complete context hierarchy and recommend a phased approach:
    
    Phase 1: Core customer CRUD with basic validation (Constraints: Performance < 200ms)
    Phase 2: Advanced search and filtering (Context: User experience priorities)
    Phase 3: Integration with notification system (Architecture: Event-driven pattern)
