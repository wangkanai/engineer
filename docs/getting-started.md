# Getting Started with Engineer IDE

Welcome to Engineer IDE! This guide will help you understand the fundamental concepts and get you up and running with context-driven development.

## What is Context Engineering?

Context engineering represents a new paradigm in software development where:

- **You focus on the "what" and "why"** - defining requirements, architecture, and strategic direction
- **AI handles the "how"** - implementing code, generating documentation, and handling repetitive tasks
- **You maintain oversight** - reviewing, approving, and guiding the AI's work

Think of yourself as an architect who designs buildings but doesn't lay every brick personally.

## Core Concepts

### Context Engineer vs Traditional Developer

| Traditional Developer | Context Engineer |
|----------------------|------------------|
| Writes code line by line | Defines high-level requirements |
| Focuses on syntax and implementation | Focuses on business logic and architecture |
| Debugs implementation details | Reviews and guides AI implementations |
| Manual testing and documentation | AI-assisted testing and documentation |

### The Context-AI Collaboration Loop

1. **Define Context**: You specify what needs to be built and why
2. **AI Implementation**: AI agents generate code based on your specifications
3. **Review & Guide**: You review the AI's work and provide feedback
4. **Iterate**: The cycle continues until the desired outcome is achieved

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have:

- .NET 8.0 SDK or later
- Visual Studio 2022, JetBrains Rider, or VS Code
- Git for version control
- AI provider API keys (OpenAI, Anthropic) or local AI setup (optional)

### Install Engineer IDE

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/wangkanai/engineer.git
cd engineer

# Restore dependencies
dotnet restore

# Build the solution
dotnet build

# Run the application
cd src/Engineer.UI
dotnet run
```

## First Steps

### 1. Setting Up AI Providers

Engineer IDE supports multiple AI providers. You can configure them in the settings:

#### Cloud Providers
- **OpenAI**: GPT-4, GPT-3.5-turbo for code generation and analysis
- **Anthropic**: Claude for advanced reasoning and code review
- **Azure OpenAI**: Enterprise-grade OpenAI integration

#### Local Providers
- **Ollama**: Run models locally for privacy and cost savings
- **Custom Models**: Integrate your own fine-tuned models

### 2. Your First Context Engineering Project

Let's walk through creating a simple web API:

#### Step 1: Define Your Project Context
```
Project Type: Web API
Technology: ASP.NET Core
Purpose: Customer management system
Key Features:
- CRUD operations for customers
- Email validation
- Audit logging
- RESTful endpoints
```

#### Step 2: Set Architecture Guidelines
```
Architecture: Clean Architecture
Database: Entity Framework with SQL Server
Authentication: JWT tokens
API Documentation: Swagger/OpenAPI
Testing: Unit tests with xUnit
```

#### Step 3: Let AI Generate the Implementation
The AI will create:
- Project structure
- Entity models
- Repository patterns
- API controllers
- Unit tests
- Documentation

#### Step 4: Review and Refine
You review the generated code and provide feedback:
- "Add input validation to the customer endpoints"
- "Include pagination for the customer list"
- "Add logging to all API operations"

### 3. Understanding the Workflow

Engineer IDE organizes work into **workflows** that define how projects progress:

```yaml
workflow:
  name: "Web API Development"
  stages:
    - requirements_analysis
    - architecture_design
    - implementation
    - testing
    - documentation
    - deployment_prep
```

Each stage has:
- **Quality gates** that must be passed to continue
- **AI agents** that handle specific tasks
- **Review points** where you provide guidance

## Working with AI Agents

### Agent Types

Engineer IDE includes specialized AI agents for different tasks:

- **Code Generation Agent**: Creates implementations from specifications
- **Architecture Agent**: Designs system structure and patterns
- **Documentation Agent**: Generates comprehensive documentation
- **Testing Agent**: Creates unit and integration tests
- **Review Agent**: Analyzes code quality and suggests improvements

### Agent Selection

The system automatically selects the best agent for each task based on:
- Task complexity and type
- Agent capabilities and specializations
- Current context and project requirements
- Performance and reliability metrics

### Providing Effective Context

To get the best results from AI agents:

#### Be Specific
❌ "Create a web API"
✅ "Create a RESTful web API for customer management with CRUD operations, email validation, and audit logging using ASP.NET Core and Entity Framework"

#### Include Constraints
```
Technical Constraints:
- Must support 1000+ concurrent users
- Response time < 200ms for list operations
- Follow company coding standards
- Compatible with existing authentication system
```

#### Provide Examples
```
Customer model should include:
- Id (GUID)
- Name (required, max 100 chars)
- Email (required, validated)
- CreatedDate (auto-generated)
- LastModified (auto-updated)
```

## Best Practices

### Context Management

1. **Start with Clear Requirements**: Define what you're building and why
2. **Establish Architecture Early**: Set technical direction before implementation
3. **Maintain Living Documentation**: Keep context updated as the project evolves
4. **Use Consistent Terminology**: Establish a project glossary

### AI Collaboration

1. **Review Everything**: AI is powerful but requires human oversight
2. **Provide Incremental Feedback**: Guide the AI with specific, actionable feedback
3. **Test Thoroughly**: Verify that AI-generated code meets your requirements
4. **Maintain Control**: You make the final decisions on all implementations

### Quality Assurance

1. **Set Quality Gates**: Define criteria that must be met at each stage
2. **Automated Testing**: Let AI generate comprehensive test suites
3. **Code Review**: Regularly review AI-generated code for quality and consistency
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Ensure AI-generated code meets performance requirements

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### AI Agent Not Responding
- Check your API key configuration
- Verify internet connectivity for cloud providers
- Check rate limits and usage quotas

#### Poor Code Quality
- Provide more specific context and requirements
- Include examples of preferred coding patterns
- Use the code review agent to identify issues

#### Workflow Stuck
- Review quality gate requirements
- Check for blocking issues in the current stage
- Manually approve stages if needed

### Getting Help

- **Documentation**: Check the docs folder for detailed guides
- **GitHub Issues**: Report bugs and request features
- **Discussions**: Ask questions and share experiences
- **Examples**: Browse the samples folder for inspiration
