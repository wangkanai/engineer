# Engineer IDE

> A revolutionary cross-platform IDE designed for context engineers to develop software, research, reports, documents, workflows, operations, and monitoring through AI-powered assistance.

## 🎯 Vision

Engineer IDE represents a paradigm shift in software development. Instead of traditional coding, **context engineers** focus on high-level oversight and strategic direction while AI agents handle the implementation details. This approach allows engineers to concentrate on understanding business requirements, system architecture, and guiding development direction rather than writing code line by line.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **.NET MAUI Blazor Hybrid**: Cross-platform foundation supporting Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android
- **Blazor Components**: Rich, interactive UI with web technologies in native shell
- **AI Agent Integration**: Flexible support for multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, local models)
- **Plugin System**: Extensible architecture for custom workflows and integrations

### Core Concepts

**Context Engineer Role**
- Define system requirements and architecture
- Provide strategic guidance and business logic
- Review and approve AI-generated implementations
- Focus on problem-solving rather than syntax

**AI Agent Layer**
- Multiple AI provider support (GPT, Claude, local LLMs)
- Intelligent code generation and refactoring
- Automated testing and documentation
- Context-aware development assistance

**Workflow Engine**
- Declarative development workflows
- Automated task orchestration
- Progress tracking and quality gates
- Integration with development tools

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- .NET 8.0 or later
- Visual Studio 2022 or JetBrains Rider
- AI API keys (optional for local models)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wangkanai/engineer.git
cd engineer
dotnet restore
dotnet build
```

### Running the Application

```bash
cd src/Engineer.UI
dotnet run
```
